Pretty much the worst Operating System ever (worse than Windows ME)

How Do I Make It?
-----------------

I think it required [http://flatassembler.net/download.php](Flat Assembler)

Progress
--------

Done:
- Boot
- Not crash
- Halt without doing an expensive spin-loop
- Print messages to the screen
- Detect Logical Block Addressing (LBA) status of the system

Todo:
- Something useful
